      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <div>Despite being born in the United States, I grew up in Mumbai, India where I did my schooling. In the 11th and 12th grade I chose electronics as a subject. I thoroughly enjoyed the theory as well as practical aspect of electronics which is why I decided to pursue electrical engineering in college. After the 12th grade I decided to complete my further education in the United States, particularly at UCLA. I am currently in my third year at UCLA. My major is electrical engineering with a technical breadth in computer science. In particular, I enjoy the field of avionics since it combines my passion for electronics with my love for aircrafts and space systems. I aspire to work in the field of avionics in the future. I also enjoy the field of Computer Science which is why I decided to pursue a technical breadth in this field. I particularly like working on projects that combine hardware and software, since these allow me to exploit my electronics background as well as my passion for computer science.
