      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <div>Despite being born in the United States, I grew up in Mumbai, India where I did my schooling. In the 11th and 12th grade I chose electronics as a subject. I thoroughly enjoyed the theory as well as practical aspect of electronics which is why I decided to pursue electrical engineering in college. After the 12th grade I decided to complete my further education in the United States, particularly at UCLA. I am currently in my third year at UCLA. My major is electrical engineering with a technical breadth in computer science. In particular, I enjoy the field of avionics since it combines my passion for electronics with my love for aircrafts and space systems. I aspire to work in the field of avionics in the future. I also enjoy the field of Computer Science which is why I decided to pursue a technical breadth in this field. I particularly like working on projects that combine hardware and software, since these allow me to exploit my electronics background as well as my passion for computer science.

      <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
      <div><h4>AEi Systems LLC - Engineering Intern (June 2016 - Present)</h4></div>
      <div>AEi Systems is a world leader in the Space market for Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA), radiation and reliability analysis, SPICE modeling and RF and power systems analysis. I work at the Los Angeles office based in Westchester. During the summer of 2016 I worked full-time and now I work part-time so that I can continue my education. I perform the following tasks:</div>
      <li>Create SPICE models for various circuit elements under the guidance of senior engineers using software such as SpiTAN and KEMET Spice</li>
      <li>Independently capture circuits using SPICE software such as PSpice, Intusoft and LTspice</li>
      <li>Simulate the captured circuits for various analysis such as Stability, Startup Inrush and Conducted Susceptibility as well as Mathcad based analysis such as Headroom and Regulation</li>
      <li>Analyze data using Excel and wrote highly technical reports for each of the analysis performed</li>
