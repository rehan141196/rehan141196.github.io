      <h3>About me:</h3>
      <div>Despite being born in the United States, I grew up in Mumbai, India where I did my schooling. In the 11th and 12th grade I chose electronics as a subject. I thoroughly enjoyed the theory as well as practical aspect of electronics which is why I decided to pursue electrical engineering in college. After the 12th grade I decided to complete my further education in the United States, particularly at UCLA. I am currently in my fourth year at UCLA. My major is Electrical Engineering with a technical breadth in Computer Science. In particular, I enjoy the field of avionics since it combines my passion for electronics with my love for aircrafts and space systems. I aspire to work in the field of avionics in the future. I also enjoy the field of Computer Science which is why I decided to pursue a technical breadth in this field. I particularly like working on projects that combine hardware and software, since these allow me to exploit my electronics background as well as my passion for computer science.

      <h3>Work Experience:</h3>
      <div><h4>Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems - Systems Engineering Intern (July 2017 - September 2017)</h4></div>
      <div>I worked on the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Satellite program on the Payload Systems Engineering team. AEHF provides secure and protected communication to the military and the government. The payload team is responsible for all the communication systems on the satellites. I performed the following tasks: </div>
      <li>Created tools in MATLAB and Python to analyze test data for satellites in production</li>
      <li>Worked in classified areas to process telemetry data from satellites in orbit</li>
      <li>Used CAD to design a camera mount and gimbal for a satellite repairing robot as a side assignment with the Robotics lab in addition to AEHF work</li>
      <div><h4>AEi Systems LLC - Engineering Intern (June 2016 - June 2017)</h4></div>
      <div>AEi Systems is a world leader in the Space market for Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA), radiation and reliability analysis, SPICE modeling and RF and power systems analysis. I work at the Los Angeles office based in Westchester. During the summer of 2016 I worked full-time and now I work part-time so that I can continue my education. I perform the following tasks:</div>
      <li>Create SPICE models for various circuit elements under the guidance of senior engineers using software such as SpiTAN and KEMET Spice</li>
      <li>Independently capture circuits using SPICE software such as PSpice, Intusoft and LTspice</li>
      <li>Simulate the captured circuits for various analysis such as Stability, Startup Inrush and Conducted Susceptibility as well as Mathcad based analysis such as Headroom and Regulation</li>
      <li>Analyze data using Excel and wrote highly technical reports for each of the analysis performed</li>
