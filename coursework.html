        <h3>Some of the relevant courses I have taken at UCLA:</h3>
        <h4>EE 102: Systems and Signals</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Winter 2016. In this class we analyzed continuous time signals and systems in the time domain, Laplace domain and frequency domain. We learnt about the various classifications of systems, the Laplace transform, the Fourier transform and sampling.
        </div>
        <h4>EE 113: Systems and Signals</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Fall 2016. In this class we understood the relationship between continuous-time and discrete-time signals. We learnt about the Z-transform, Discrete Time Fourier Transform, Discrete Fourier Transform, sampling and the Nyquist Theorem.
        </div>
        <h4>CS 33: Introduction to Computer Organization</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Spring 2016. This was an introductory course on computer architecture, assembly language and operating system fundamentals. We also learnt about memory management and how to write efficient code. This class also gave us an introduction to parallel programming. This was one of my favorite classes at UCLA becasue the projects assigned were very interesting.
        </div>
        <h4>CS M117: Computer Networks - Physical Layer</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Fall 2016. It introduced us to fundamental computer communication concepts underlying and supporting modern networks. The class mainly foucussed on WLAN (IEEE 802.11) and Bluetooth. The class was project based and required us to create a project using some form of wireless communication.
        </div>
        <h4>CS M51A: Logic Design of Digital Systems</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Spring 2015. This class introduced us to logic gates and devices such as multiplexers, demultiplexers and FPGAs. We learnt the specifications and implementation of combinational and sequential systems. This class also gave us a basic understanding of Verilog.
        </div>
        <h4>EE 10: Circuit Theory I and EE 11L: Circuit Laboratory I</h4>
        <div>I took these classes in Winter 2016. In the theory class we learnt linear circuit analysis with resistive, capacitive and inductive circuits. We also learnt about transformers, Kirchoff's Laws, node and loop analysis, first-order circuits, second-order circuits, Thevenin's and Norton's theorem and sinusoidal steady state. The lab class made us perfrom experiments based on what we learnt in theory.
        </div>
        <h4>EE 101A: Engineering Electromagnetics</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Fall 2016. This class taught us Maxwell's equations, static and quasi-static electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic field concepts, waves and phasors, transmission lines and Smith charts. It also gave us a qualitative understanding of the various fields of research in photonics.
        </div>
        <h4>EE 2: Physics for Electrical Engineers</h4>
        <div>I took this class in Spring 2016. This class hgave us an introduction to concepts of modern physics necessary to understand solid-state devices, including elementary quantum theory, Fermi energies, and concepts of electrons in solids. We also discussed the electrical properties of semiconductors leading to operation of junction devices.
